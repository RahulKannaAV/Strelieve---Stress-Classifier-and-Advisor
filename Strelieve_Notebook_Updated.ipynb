Here are some tailored stress advice suggestions:\\n\\n**Rapid Heartbeat Status:**\\n\\n1. **Deep Breathing Exercises**: Practice slow, deep breathing exercises to help calm your heart rate. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. Repeat this process several times a day.\\n2. **Physical Activity**: Engage in regular physical activity that you enjoy, such as walking, jogging, yoga, or swimming. This can help regulate your heart rate and reduce overall stress levels.\\n3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Practice progressive muscle relaxation to release physical tension. Start with your toes and work your way up to your head, tensing and relaxing each muscle group in turn.\\n\\n**Eustress Classification:**\\n\\n1. **Embrace the Challenge**: Since you\\'ve classified your stress as Eustress, view it as an opportunity to grow and learn. Embrace the challenge and focus on finding creative solutions.\\n2. **Prioritize Self-Care**: With Eustress, it\\'s essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Ensure you\\'re getting enough sleep (7-9 hours), eating nutritious food, and taking breaks throughout the day.\\n3. **Reframe Negative Thoughts**: Since Eustress is motivating, try reframing any negative thoughts into positive affirmations. Replace \"I\\'m so overwhelmed\" with \"I can handle this challenge!\"\\n\\n**Additional Tips:**\\n\\n1. **Journaling**: Write down your thoughts, feelings, and accomplishments to help process and release stress.\\n2. **Social Support**: Surround yourself with supportive friends, family, or a therapist who can offer emotional validation and guidance.\\n3. **Time Management**: Prioritize tasks effectively, set realistic goals, and take regular breaks to maintain a sense of control and reduce overall stress.\\n\\nRemember that it\\'s essential to listen to your body and take care of your physical health when experiencing rapid heartbeat. If you\\'re concerned about your heart rate or have any underlying medical conditions, consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.\\n\\nBy incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can better manage your Eustress and maintain a healthy work-life balance.', thinking=None, context=[128006, 882, 128007, 271, 36227, 1063, 8631, 9650, 389, 279, 8197, 315, 279, 1217, 4787, 13, 48090, 53205, 2704, 25, 2052, 279, 892, 612, 51568, 21771, 439, 469, 592, 676, 555, 856, 34465, 1646, 13, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 2675, 2351, 25051, 11295, 53205, 320, 543, 279, 892, 8, 323, 2980, 701, 8631, 5990, 311, 387, 469, 592, 676, 11, 902, 374, 264, 6928, 323, 89689, 955, 315, 8631, 13, 5810, 527, 1063, 41891, 8631, 9650, 18726, 1473, 334, 49, 44221, 18449, 23019, 8266, 25, 57277, 16, 13, 3146, 34564, 11681, 44661, 91554, 96618, 28082, 6435, 11, 5655, 27027, 23783, 311, 1520, 19858, 701, 4851, 4478, 13, 763, 71, 1604, 369, 220, 19, 6622, 11, 3412, 369, 220, 22, 6622, 11, 323, 57759, 1604, 369, 220, 23, 6622, 13, 45901, 420, 1920, 3892, 3115, 264, 1938, 627, 17, 13, 3146, 40353, 15330, 96618, 3365, 425, 304, 5912, 7106, 5820, 430, 499, 4774, 11, 1778, 439, 11689, 11, 99738, 11, 27102, 11, 477, 24269, 13, 1115, 649, 1520, 37377, 701, 4851, 4478, 323, 8108, 8244, 8631, 5990, 627, 18, 13, 3146, 9685, 535, 68427, 68685, 367, 96618, 28082, 23053, 16124, 43685, 311, 4984, 7106, 24408, 13, 5256, 449, 701, 45713, 323, 990, 701, 1648, 709, 311, 701, 2010, 11, 22781, 287, 323, 34948, 1855, 16124, 1912, 304, 2543, 382, 334, 36, 592, 676, 55982, 25, 57277, 16, 13, 3146, 2321, 32337, 279, 26323, 96618, 8876, 499, 3077, 21771, 701, 8631, 439, 469, 592, 676, 11, 1684, 433, 439, 459, 6776, 311, 3139, 323, 4048, 13, 5867, 32337, 279, 8815, 323, 5357, 389, 9455, 11782, 10105, 627, 17, 13, 3146, 50571, 27406, 10323, 7813, 548, 96618, 3161, 469, 592, 676, 11, 433, 596, 7718, 311, 10519, 264, 9498, 990, 26928, 8335, 13, 30379, 499, 2351, 3794, 3403, 6212, 320, 22, 12, 24, 4207, 705, 12459, 78216, 3691, 11, 323, 4737, 18808, 6957, 279, 1938, 627, 18, 13, 3146, 697, 6906, 51957, 61399, 96618, 8876, 469, 592, 676, 374, 89689, 11, 1456, 19914, 6605, 904, 8389, 11555, 1139, 6928, 33449, 811, 13, 30658, 330, 40, 2846, 779, 43206, 1, 449, 330, 40, 649, 3790, 420, 8815, 17642, 334, 30119, 26788, 25, 57277, 16, 13, 3146, 44594, 287, 96618, 9842, 1523, 701, 11555, 11, 16024, 11, 323, 53881, 311, 1520, 1920, 323, 4984, 8631, 627, 17, 13, 3146, 27414, 9365, 96618, 100060, 6261, 449, 33445, 4885, 11, 3070, 11, 477, 264, 42863, 889, 649, 3085, 14604, 10741, 323, 19351, 627, 18, 13, 3146, 1489, 9744, 96618, 32499, 27406, 9256, 13750, 11, 743, 26569, 9021, 11, 323, 1935, 5912, 18808, 311, 10519, 264, 5647, 315, 2585, 323, 8108, 8244, 8631, 382, 29690, 430, 433, 596, 7718, 311, 9020, 311, 701, 2547, 323, 1935, 2512, 315, 701, 7106, 2890, 994, 25051, 11295, 53205, 13, 1442, 499, 2351, 11920, 922, 701, 4851, 4478, 477, 617, 904, 16940, 6593, 4787, 11, 8666, 449, 264, 18985, 6721, 369, 35649, 19351, 382, 1383, 52913, 1521, 10631, 1139, 701, 7446, 14348, 11, 499, 649, 2731, 10299, 701, 469, 592, 676, 323, 10519, 264, 9498, 990, 26928, 8335, 13])"
